**Roles:**
- **Admin** — full dashboard, billing config, user management, report export
- **Gatekeeper** — entry form, exit/billing flow, personal session history

---

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
python ../main.py
```

Or start the stack manually:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Configuration is already in `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env`. Edit those files if you need to change credentials, CORS origins, database settings, or MSG91 keys.

The first boot automatically:
1. Runs Alembic migrations
2. Seeds the root admin account
3. Seeds the default gatekeeper account
4. Seeds default billing rules

Open `http://localhost` and log in with:

| Role | Mobile | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `7200775876` | `0000` |
| Gatekeeper | `8888888888` | `0000` |

## Local Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# edit .env if you need a different DATABASE_URL

alembic upgrade head
python -m app.db.seed

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# → http://localhost:8000
# → http://localhost:8000/docs  (Swagger UI)
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# edit .env if you need a different NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL

npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

### Tests

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/
```

## Billing Engine

Rules are admin-configurable from the UI — no code changes needed.

**Example (default seed):**

| Rule | Range | Charge |
|---|---|---|
| First 12 Hours | 0–12h | ₹100 |
| 12–24 Hours | 12–24h | ₹150 |
| Additional Day | >24h (open-ended) | ₹100/day (ceil-rounded) |

Open-ended rules (no "To Hours") charge `amount × ceil(extra_hours / 24)` per additional day beyond their "From Hours" threshold.

## MSG91 WhatsApp Notifications

Configure via **Admin Panel → Settings**:

- `MSG91 AuthKey` — from the MSG91 dashboard
- `WhatsApp Number` — your registered business number
- `Entry Template Name` — the WhatsApp template to use on entry
- `Exit Template Name` — the WhatsApp template to use on exit/payment

Notifications are fire-and-forget (background task) — a failed notification never blocks entry/exit. Every attempt is recorded in the `notifications` table for audit.

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Set a strong `SECRET_KEY` (32+ random bytes)
- [ ] Change `ROOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` immediately after first login
- [ ] Configure MSG91 credentials in Admin → Settings
- [ ] Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your actual domain(s)
- [ ] Point `DATABASE_URL` to a managed PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] Add SSL termination in Nginx (Let's Encrypt / Certbot)
- [ ] Set up automated DB backups (pg_dump or managed DB snapshots)
- [ ] Replace local `uploads/` with cloud object storage (AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2) for photo storage in production

## Render + Supabase Deployment

The application stores data in PostgreSQL. In the current schema, the admin and every
managed user are rows in the `users` table. Operational data is stored in the same
Supabase database in tables such as `tenants`, `trucks`, `parking_sessions`, `payments`,
`billing_rules`, `system_settings`, and `notifications`. `tenant_id` scopes business data
so multiple parking yards can share one database without mixing records.

The repository includes `render.yaml` for the backend service. Create a Supabase project,
copy its connection string into Render's `DATABASE_URL`, and set these production secrets:

- `SECRET_KEY`: a random value of at least 32 characters
- `ROOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: the initial root-admin password
- `GATEKEEPER_PASSWORD`: the initial default gatekeeper password
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: the deployed frontend origin, for example `https://app.example.com`

Render runs `alembic upgrade head` before starting the API, so migrations create the
Supabase schema. The seed command is idempotent and only creates missing bootstrap users;
it no longer overwrites passwords on every deploy. Use the Users screen to change them.

For Supabase, use the pooler or direct PostgreSQL URL with the `postgresql://` format;
the backend converts it to the async SQLAlchemy driver automatically. Connection pooling
is deliberately capped because each Render worker opens its own pool. Keep uploaded photos
in S3, Cloudflare R2, or Supabase Storage for production; Render's local filesystem is
ephemeral and is not a database or durable file store.
